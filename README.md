# HWforWeek6

For this week’s homework you will have to add a number of files to your previous homework – recommended (or add the content from these files to your ever growing single file homework – not recommended).

The files/content you need to add, translate, and edit are all located in a folder on our share drive named: Week6Homework.

Add/translate the class “Road” and the enum definition of “Heading” from the file Road.cs. You can cut out any commented out sections, or leave them in as comments as we will use them later.

Add/translate the static class “Conversions” from Common.cs. Many of you will not find a direct translation, but should be able to implement the intent of the concept of static.

Add/translate the class “Map” from Map.cs. Most of you will have to find an alternative way to implement the concept of passing a generic object (review the class slides on how to do this).



Add/translate the code from SUI.cs. This will be the most lines of code, but it should also be the most direct to translate.

Finally, add/translate and edit your main program with the code from Program.cs:
Add the following constants:
*WorldSize
*CharMapSize
*MetersToKm
*MetersToMiles
Comment out your code to create vehicles and show their speed and replace with the remainder of the code from my Main
Add CreateRoad to:
*Abstract class GUI
*Class MetricGUI
*Class ImperialGUI
